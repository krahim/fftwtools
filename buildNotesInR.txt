This is my current attempt at a minimalist set of tools to build fftwtools R package on various platforms. FFTW **must** be installed on the platforms for this to work.

I tested this by building the package on LINUX --as-cran prior to uploading to CRAN. I have not recently tested this build on Windows or Mac but to my knowledge contributers have. 

configure.ac 		## required for Linux, macOS, ... builds 
configure               ## generated from configure.ac by calling autoconf
src/Makevars.in         ## used by configure as input
src/Makevars            ## create by configure, temporary file, removed by cleanup
src/Makevars.win        ## 'fixed' as paths on the CRAN Windows build machine do not change

Note this differs from the multitaper package which requires the following files: 
configure.ac
src/Makevars
src/Makevars.in
src/makevars.win

This is due to how I set up configure script in fftwtools which requires an external package. In the case of the multitaper package, BLAS and LAPACK (in 64bit versions) are included in R.

Note that .gitignore and .Rbuildignore operate differently. .Rbuildignore uses perl regular expressions but .gitignore seems to match files using the file wildcards we use when using "ls".
